# Red wine analysis using R

The goal of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis on a dataset containing wine information and to explore the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships in the dataset. I tried to answer the following questions:

- Which chemical properties are correlated?
- Is there a relation between quality and the alcohol level?
- Are there any parameters which strongly influence the alcohol level in wine?

The project uses [red wines dataset](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2009.05.016) published by P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis.
